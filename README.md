# p2kit

Project management for Claude Code, **aligned with PRINCE2®** — not affiliated with or endorsed
by PeopleCert or AXELOS. PRINCE2® is a registered trademark of PeopleCert. All templates here are
written from scratch.

- **Skills, one per process.** Claude drafts the management products (Project Brief, PID, plans,
  reports) from what you tell it; the Project Board — you — decides.
- **Data in your repo.** Everything lives in `.pm/` in the project's own repository, versioned with
  git: `project.yaml`, Markdown products with frontmatter, YAML registers. Stage baselines are git
  tags `pm/stage-<n>-approved`. Schema: [docs/pm-schema.md](docs/pm-schema.md).
- **Project desk.** A side pane in the Claude Desktop Code tab with every registered project:
  stage, progress, tolerance status, open high risks, next report due — and a drill-in with roles,
  documents, registers and work packages. Also available as a local browser page.
- **Stage delivery.** A stage linked in `project.yaml` to an issue or milestone and a branch shows
  the phases of the phased-workflow plan found on that branch and its commits, read with local
  git, with internal notes on them kept in `.pm/registers/commit-notes.yaml`, and the forge state
  of its issue or milestone and pull requests (GitHub or Forgejo, read-only), flagged `ready to
  close` when they are all merged.
- **Light by default.** The `light` tailoring profile keeps only what a small project needs;
  `full` adds the rest.

Status: phase 1 skeleton, under development.

## Skills

| Skill | Does |
|---|---|
| `/pm-start-up` | turns a project mandate into a Project Brief and creates `.pm/project.yaml` |
| `/pm-initiate` | drafts the Project Initiation Documentation (light profile) and the first stage |
| `/pm-note` | adds or closes an internal note on a commit of the stage branch (`.pm/registers/commit-notes.yaml`) |
| `/pm-register` | adds the current repo to the project desk (`~/.config/p2kit/projects.yaml`) |

`/pm-desk` opens the pane.

## Install (development)

The repository root is the plugin. Load it in every session by naming it in the `env` block of
`~/.claude/settings.json`: `"CLAUDE_CODE_PLUGIN_DIRS": "<path to this repo>"` (several paths are
separated by `:`), or for one session `claude --plugin-dir <path>`.

```bash
claude plugin validate .
```

```bash
claude plugin test .
```
